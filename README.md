👋 Hi, I’m @msharma24

I am Mukesh Sharma, a Cloud Migrations and DevSecOps specialist based in New Zealand with strong expertise in designing SaaS and cloud-native solutions on AWS Cloud

Over the past 10 years, I’ve helped from start-ups to large enterprises attain business agility, improve security, and elevate risk response. For instance, I’ve supported a major retail organization in New Zealand with SAP solutions on AWS. I’ve also helped a large US-based enterprise to achieve compliance (FEDRAMP) on AWS.

My skills include Infrastructure as Code tools, such as Terraform and Cloudformation (I frequently contribute to open-source projects), and Ansible and Puppet configuration management

I am also an [AWS Ambassador](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/ambassadors/?cards-body.sort-by=item.additionalFields.ambassadorName&cards-body.sort-order=asc&awsf.apn-ambassadors-location=*all&cards-body.q=Mukesh%2BSharma&cards-body.q_operator=AND) , and I currently provide services for an AWS Consulting Partner.

If you’re looking for DevOps and Cloud architectural assistance, please get in touch.
