ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @msharma24

I am Mukesh Sharma, a Cloud Migrations and DevSecOps specialist based in New Zealand with strong expertise in designing SaaS and cloud-native solutions on AWS Cloud.

Over the past 10 years, Iâ€™ve helped start-ups and large enterprises attain business agility, improve security, and elevate risk response. For instance, Iâ€™ve supported a major retail organization in New Zealand with SAP solutions on AWS. Iâ€™ve also helped a sizeable US-based enterprise to achieve compliance (FEDRAMP) on AWS.

My skills include Infrastructure as Code tools, such as Terraform and Cloudformation (I frequently contribute to open-source projects), and Ansible and Puppet configuration management.


If youâ€™re looking for DevOps and Cloud architectural assistance, please get in touch.
